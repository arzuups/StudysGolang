- The "main" package is the starting point of the Go program and the "main()" function in the "main" package runs the program.
- "func" keyword is used to define a function in Go.
- In Go Language, the content of each function always starts with "{".
- In Go, every function always ends with "}".
- "fmt.Print" prints the terminal results side by side.
- With the "fmt.Printf" function we can insert variables between textual sections.
- "fmt.Println" prints the terminal results, one below the other.

- We can create a folder using "mkdir". We can also display the folder in the terminal using the "cd" command.
- ```Example: C:\> mkdir goWorks C:\> cd goWorks```

-  %T => Means type is used to find out which data type the function is. 
-  ```Example: kdv3 =: 39.4 fmt.Println(kdv3) fmt.Printf("data type : %T" , kdv3)```

- Used to assign one "=" value.
- The use of "\" allows the output of the code to be written one below the other in the terminal.
- By saying "go mod init and typing a module name" you can create a module.
- "!=" means is text1 != different from text2 ?
- The condition in the "if" block is always written in parentheses.
- "fmt.Sprintf" is a function that provides formatting functionality.

```IF - ELSE IF - ELSE```
- IF => The "if" construct checks if the specified condition is true and if so, executes the specified block of code.
- ELSE IF => The "else if" structure checks the next condition if the condition of the previous "if" structure is false.It is used when more than one condition needs to be checked.
- ELSE => The "else" construct specifies a block of code that will be executed if no conditions are met. This construct has no conditions and can only be used once.

- "For" means infinite loop.
- "Arrays" are used to hold data of the same data type.
- In arrays, the counting number starts from 0.
- ``` Example: var numbers [5] int number [2] = 80 fmt.Println(numbers) TERMINAL OUTPUT == [0,0,80,0,0]```
		  
- Use ":=" to assign a variable.
- The "Append" function creates a new slice-array.
- An int that is an address is different from an int that is a value.
- Arrays do not operate on their values, they are sent with their addresses in memory.
- In Go, "get" is a command used to install, update and manage packages.
- In Go, "post" is a method for sending HTTP requests to the server.
- If the "" sign is placed and a space is inserted between it, a space is inserted between the two words.
- rand.Intn() => It takes a random number between 0 and 100 but not 100.
- time.Sleep(time.Second) => Holds for the entered number and prints the next value.
- // %s == Used for String values.
- // %d == Used for Ä°nt values.
- // %f == Used for float32(etc) values.
